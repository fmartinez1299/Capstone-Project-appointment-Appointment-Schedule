# Capstone-Project-appointment-Appointment-Schedule
Appointment Scheduler - Project Proposal

Overview

The Appointment Scheduler is a web-based application designed to streamline the scheduling process for medical offices. It allows doctors and receptionists to manage appointments efficiently while enabling patients to book available slots online. The system ensures real-time updates, preventing double bookings and conflicts.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js with Express (or Django if using Python)

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB

Authentication: JWT-based login system

APIs: Potential integration with Google Calendar API

Focus

This will be a full-stack application with an evenly distributed focus on both frontend UI and backend functionality.

Type

The project will be a web-based application, accessible via desktop and mobile browsers.

Goal

The primary goal of the Appointment Scheduler is to provide a seamless and efficient scheduling system for medical offices. It will reduce administrative workload, prevent scheduling conflicts, and improve patient experience by offering an easy-to-use online booking system.

Users

Doctors: View and manage their schedules.

Receptionists: Book and manage appointments manually.

Patients: Book available appointments online.

Data & Collection Plan

User Data: Doctors, receptionists, and patients will have user accounts with relevant profile details.

Appointment Data: Stores information about booked appointments, available slots, and cancellations.

Notifications Data: Logs email/SMS reminders sent to users.

Integration Data: If using Google Calendar API, syncs schedules with external calendars.

Database Schema (Initial Draft)

Users Table: Stores user details, roles (doctor, receptionist, patient), and authentication credentials.

Appointments Table: Stores appointment details, including date, time, doctor, patient, and status.

Notifications Table: Stores reminders and notification logs.

Potential API Challenges

Google Calendar Integration: Managing API rate limits and authentication challenges.

Real-Time Updates: Ensuring immediate reflection of scheduling changes without conflicts.

Security Considerations: Implementing role-based access control and data encryption.

Key Functionalities
